\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}


\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sect:objectives}

 The objective of this test plan is to verify the Hexapods requirements
will still be met after changing the design of the encoders on the
hexapod actuators. In order to do this, a series of tests will be
conducted on a single actuator first and then a subset of these tests
will be repeated with the remaining actuators. Once all of the actuators
have been verified, there will be a final verification event for the
entire hexapod.



\subsection{System Overview}
\label{sect:systemoverview}

 \begin{itemize}
\item
  Both the M2 Cell Assembly and Camera use hexapods to facilitate rigid
  body optical positioning relative to the M1M3 Mirror. These hexapods
  utilize identical actuators to facilitate ease of maintainability and
  interchangeability.Actuators incorporate a rotary motor, harmonic
  drive, and a screw. An absolute linear encoder measures the actuator
  length and a relative rotary encoder measures the motor rotation;
  smooth, stiction free flexures provide end rotations; software limits
  electrical limit switches, and hard stops limit travel. Each Actuator
  weighs \textasciitilde{}58.8 kg and measures 620 mm in length.~
\item
  Due to various issues/damages, linear encoders of the hexapod
  actuators will need repair/service/replacement.~

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Replacing/servicing the encoder head or tape requires disassembly
    the actuators.
  \item
    Disassembling an actuator requires removing it from the hexapod.
  \item
    Removing the hexapod requires first removing the payload, either the
    camera or M2 mirror cell assembly. ~ ~ ~~
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Hence, all actuators will adopt a modified design to facilitate in
  situ servicing of the linear encoder.
\end{itemize}

When determining the center stroke position, the internal rotary encoder
reported -22.008mm. However, during the Unmodified Single Hexapod
Actuator Redesign Verification campaign, the center stroke position was
seen to be -40.202mm. Since the external linear encoders reported to be
about 39.5mm during both campaigns, this change seen in the center
stroke position was determined to be okay. One possible explanation for
why this was changed is because the actuator may have been rotated
during the modification which would have resulted in a different
internal rotary encoder reading.

In order to prevent over stressing the actuator, this test was only
conducted on the modified actuator. During this test, there were no
obvious signs of damage so this test was considered passed. The data

During the Unmodified Actuator Verification campaign, the internal
rotary encoder reading was not recorded and so the displacement as
measured by the external linear encoders were recorded instead. However,
during this Modified Actuator Verification campaign, the back driving
test was able to be conducted using the readings from the internal
rotary encoder. As a result, it can be seen in the steps below that the
back driving measured during this test was measured to be under 10
counts for both tension and compression load. The data as measured by
the external linear encoders can be seen in the attached \emph{Back
Drive Test Results - Unmodified Actuator (1).xlsm} excel file.

The actuator was placed as close to the positive limit switch as
possible when extended and as close to the negative limit switch as
possible when retracted.\\
As a reminder, the reported position of the rotary encoder were
different after the actuator modifications.\\
Negative Limit Switch:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-36.03mm or
  -36003000counts}
\end{itemize}

Zero Position:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-22.008mm or -2200875
  counts}
\end{itemize}

Positive Limit Switch:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-7.515mm or -7515000
  counts}
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, the stiffness of the actuator was seen in the following
positions as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Zero Position = 101.6N/um
\item
  Negative Limit Switch = 101.4N/um
\item
  Positive Limit Switch = 101.6N/um
\end{itemize}

The results from both the unmodified and modified actuator tests have
been uploaded into docushare. As seen in the Results Summary sheet,
Moog's results showed that the stiffness of the actuator was on average
117N/um. The results from the unmodified actuator stiffness test showed
that the actuator was on average 130N/um. It can be seen that the
actuator is a lot less stiff than MOOG's original results and the
results obtained from the unmodified test. It can be seen in the results
of the attached document that there is not only larger displacement in
the modified actuator test results, but there is a larger delta between
the two encoder positions. An explanation for this may be due to the
fact that the modified design includes a cutout meant for the external
encoder housing that is causing a twisting moment. As a result, this is
causing displacement at a higher rate for one encoder than the other.
This can be seen in the graphs plotting velocity of the encoders vs time
on the Velocity Graphs\emph{~}sheet of the
\href{https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Services/Document-55068}{\emph{Stiffness

Similar to MOOG's original procedure and the unmodified actuator
movement test, the settling time started when the actuator had reached
its commanded position of +/-5mm and ended when the displacement was
within 0.001mm of that position. As seen in the results of this test
case, the actuator was capable of accurately reaching the +/-5mm
commanded position and the settling time was again seen to be less than
2 seconds. This can be seen in the attached
\href{https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Services/Document-55079}{\emph{Movement
Test Results - Modified Actuator.xlsx}}\emph{~}excel file.\\
The results of both tension and compression were combined in order to
observe the actuator movement throughout the full test.

The purpose of this test was to verify that the limit switches would
prevent the actuator from moving beyond an unsafe range of motion. The
actuator can incur serious damage if allowed to move beyond +/-15mm.
Therefore, the limits switches were set to be around +/-14.3mm, which is
within the +/-15mm but capable of allowing the overall hexapod range of
motion requirements to still be met.\\
During the Modified Actuator Verification Campaign, a new set of limit
switches had to be installed. However, the paddles on the limit switches
were not bent exactly like the original limit switches. As a result, the
limit switches had to be manually readjusted to trigger as close as
possible to the original +/-14.3mm. The calculations that were used to
determine the necessary adjustment are seen in the attached document.\\
Overall, this test was considered to be passed as the limit switches
were readjusted and seen to stop the actuator from moving beyond its
range of motion. The full range of motion is listed below:\\
Negative Limit Switch:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-36.03mm or
  -36003000counts}
\item
  Encoder A (D13B) = 53.28mm
\item
  Encoder B (D0BD) = 53.73mm
\end{itemize}

Zero Position:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-22.008mm or -2200875
  counts}
\item
  Encoder A (D13B) = 39.4mm
\item
  Encoder B (D0BD) = 39.5mm
\end{itemize}

Positive Limit Switch:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-7.515mm or
  -7515000counts}
\item
  Encoder A (D13B) = 24.78mm
\item
  Encoder B (D0BD) = 25.23mm
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, the stiffness of the actuator was seen in the following
positions as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Zero Position = 101.6N/um
\item
  Negative Limit Switch = 101.4N/um
\item
  Positive Limit Switch = 101.6N/um~

The expected result of this test was that given 100nm moves with any
load, the actuator would reach the commanded position within 50nm.
However, there were some deviations to the 100nm moves seen to be
greater than 50nm. This was expected as MOOG's original test results
described similar issues related to excessive noise on the load cell and
on the external encoders. Additionally, a load compensation could not be
performed with the displacement being measured in nm's. Therefore, since
the encoders were seen to be able to track the actuator movement closely
and in the correct commanded direction, this test was passed.

For this we started at the Zero Position:\\

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-22.008mm or -2200875
  counts}
\item
  Encoder A (D13B) = 39.4mm
\item
  Encoder B (D0BD) = 39.5mm
\end{itemize}

During this test, it can be seen in the results that there were
variations in the applied load that may have impacted the results of
this test. As a result of the noise, there were outliers to the expected
accuracy, specifically for the larger moves in mm. For the smaller moves
in um, the accuracy was less than the expected error. However, this was
expected as MOOG's original test report cites the same variation when
applying load. Therefore, load compensation was applied to the results
in an effort to reduce the noise's impact on the results. Applying load
compensation improved the overall results, but there were still some
outliers that were greater than the expected 17um for the large moves:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Large scale accuracy maximum error - Tension = \textbf{22.65um}
\item
  Large scale accuracy maximum error - Compression = \textbf{24.76um}
\item
  Large scale accuracy maximum error - Zero = \textbf{41.54um}
\end{itemize}

For the smaller moves, the maximum error was less than the expected
20um:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Small scale accuracy maximum error - Tension = 12.25um
\item
  Small scale accuracy maximum error - Compression = 17.7um
\item
  Small scale accuracy maximum error - Zero = 16.8um
\end{itemize}

Overall, the absolute accuracy of the actuators are not critical for the
operation of the hexapods. Therefore, the results have been recorded and
this test was marked as passed.

An initial sequence of 20 moves was performed and the actuator
temperature was seen to rise from 23.65degC to 28.5degC without any
indication of stopping. The operational limit of the actuator drive was
cited to be from 0 to 40degC. Therefore, we added a fan to prevent the
temperature from increasing beyond 30degC during the test. During the
tests, the temperature readings could not be exported while the
telemetry was being displayed in real time. Therefore, the temperature
telemetry was left on display to verify the temperature never reached
above 30degC. As a result of this test, the temperature never rose
beyond 30degC with the fan on the actuator and there were no obvious
damage/faults on the actuator.~

The purpose of this test was to ensure that the application of load was
not affecting the results by causing the encoders to separate too far
from the encoder tapes. As a result of this test, it was visually
confirmed that the encoders remained properly spaced during commanded
moves with load applied.\\
As seen in the videos included in the docushare collection, the encoders
visually remain the same distance away from the encoder tape. However,
the real indication that the encoders are sufficiently spaced is the LED
on the encoder. The LED turns blue when the encoder is the correct
distance away from the encoder tape. If the LED is green, orange, or
red, this indicates the signal is not as strong (with red being the
worst). However, since the encoders were seen to be blue for the full
test, this test can be considered to be passed.

The test was executed initially by applying steps for forces in
compression first and then tension. When applying forces in compression,
we started with the supply pressure = 20psi. As we applied more load in
compression, we also gradually increased the air supply. By doing this,
we were able to safely observe the rate that the load was being applied
at lower pressures first before increasing to the maximum air pressure.
As a result, we determined that load could be applied safely onto the
actuator and at least 90psi is required to be able to apply a load of
+/-60kN.

stiffness was very high and had less than 1\% impact on the measured

In conclusion, the stiffness of the actuator was seen in the following
positions as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Zero Position = 131.6 N/um
\item
  Extended Position (Positive Limit position) = 135.39 N/um

During the test, the velocity and acceleration limits could not be
changed in the Copley control software. However, the limits were already
set to the desired velocity and acceleration. As a result, we verified
that the actuator was still capable of meeting the minimum velocity of
the 0.342mm/s. The settling time was also verified by this test.\\
According to MOOG's original procedure, the settling time started when
the actuator had reached its commanded position of +/-5mm and ended when
the displacement was within 0.001mm of that commanded position. As seen
in the results of this test case, the settling time was always seen to
be less than 2 seconds. This is supported by the raw data as seen in the

\subsection{Overall Assessment}
\label{sect:overallassessment}

Overall, the tests for unmodified and modified actuator were seen to be
a PASS.\\[2\baselineskip]\textbf{Proofing Test:~}Without motor power
applied to the actuator, a 60kN tension and a 60kN compression load was
applied to the modified actuator. This corresponds to 2X the maximum
expected load. No unexpected movements or sounds were recorded to
indicate any catastrophic failure for the modified actuator. There were
no signs of any visual crack in the test unit as
well.\\[2\baselineskip]\textbf{Backdriving Test} : Without motor power
applied to the actuator, a 37.5kN tension and a 37.5kN compression load
was applied to the modified actuator. This corresponds to 1.25X the
maximum expected load. During the tension test, the actuator's rotary
encoder position changed by 3 counts. During the compression test, the
actuator's rotary encoder position changed by 2 count. There were no
visual signs of motion during either test. Less than 10 counts of motion
was considered non-backdriving, so the actuator passed the test and did
not backdrive. For reference, 500,000 encoder counts are equivalent to
one rotation of the roller screw, so 2-3 counts represent negligible
motion. Note- we could not record the rotary encoder reading at the time
of unmodified actuator test campaign.\\[2\baselineskip]\textbf{Stiffness
Test:} The stiffness test was performed by starting at zero load,
applying a tension load up to 30kN, reducing the load back to zero,
applying a compression load up to 30kN, and reducing the load to zero
while measuring the displacement with the two external linear encoders.
For the unmodified actuator, zero position stiffness was measured as
131.6 N/um, positive limit position stiffness was 135.8 N/um and
negative limit position stiffness was 126.7 N/um. For the modified
actuator, all position stiffness were measured as \textasciitilde{}101
N/um which is 13\% lower than the Moog's average stiffness
of\textasciitilde{}117 N/um. We further analyzed the results to
determine the root cause of this reduction in stiffness by producing
graphs on difference of displacements and velocity for the external
encoders. It can be elucidated that additional groove for the linear
encoder on the one side of the actuator (encoder B side) might have
created a moment generated twisting effect and the actuator tilted more
on the Encoder A (heavier) side. As a result of that, encoder A was
showing higher rate of displacement as compared to encoder B for the
modified actuator. Overall, the stiffness results are still reasonable
to meet the hexapod level stiffness
requirements.\\[2\baselineskip]\textbf{Movement Test~}: The velocity
test was performed by commanding the actuator to move from one end of
its stroke to the other under either a 15kN compression or tension load.
For both the unmodified and modified actuators, in all four cases
whether extending or retraction under tension or compression loads, the
average velocity was close to 0.5mm/s according to the internal linear
encoder and excluding the acceleration and deceleration periods. The
external linear encoder measurements confirmed that the velocities were
nearly 0.5mm/s on average for both the unmodified and modified
actuators, which is more than the expected minimum velocity of 0.342
mm/s. The settle time was recorded as less than 2 seconds for both the
modified and unmodified actuators , which is similar to Moog's
results.Then, both the modified and unmodified actuators were able to
travel 0.342mm in less than 2 seconds. Note, these velocity, settle and
slew values were determined by Moog as the actuator level specification
in order to meet the hexapod level
requirements.\\[2\baselineskip]\textbf{Range of Motion Test:~}The
purpose of the range of motion test was to determine the position of the
limit switches and verify the actuator could not be commanded further
into the direction of the limit switches once they were tripped. Moog's
original procedure involved using a separate software to set software
actuator stroke limits to further limit the actuator's range of motion.
However, for this test, those steps were skipped and only the limit
switches were used. During the unmodified actuator tests, we expected
the range of motion to be about +/-14.5mm. As a result of the test, the
limit switches were seen to be set at +/-14.298mm. This was sufficient
as it was determined that about +/-14mm was required for the actuator's
range of motion in order to meet the translation range at the hexapod
level. For the modified actuator tests, the limit switches were replaced
with a new set and the new range of motion was seen to be smaller.
However, this was because the paddles of the limit switches were not
bent in exactly the same way. Therefore, the limit switches had to be
manually readjusted to be as close to +/-14.3mm as possible. Overall,
the test was passed as the actuator was still capable of meeting the
+/-14mm range of motion.\\

\textbf{Resolution Test:~}Resolution was tested by taking several 100nm
steps in multiple directions and measuring external encoder readings
with the commanded value at the recorded timestamps. The nominal load
for the tension and compression tests was +/-15kN. Similar to Moog's
test, due to noise on the external encoder signals it was difficult to
get usable data. However, as we recorded the timestamps and displacement
immediately after the commanded moves, we can fairly state that the
external encoders show motion in the appropriate direction and was
within the 50\% of the commanded 100 nm step size. However, in some
cases the step size deviated by more than 50\% for both the modified and
unmodified actuators, which was the result of shifts in load level and
noise on the harmonic motor drive.The load cell signal was too noisy to
perform load compensation at these small displacement levels. Moog's
results conveyed similar issues to our test results. In addition, we got
similar results for unmodified and modified actuators. Hence, we suggest
that the modified actuator meets the resolution test.~

\textbf{Accuracy Test:} Large-scale accuracy was tested by making
several large moves across the entire range of motion of the actuator
and comparing the error between the internal linear encoder measurements
and the two external linear encoder measurements. The load did not
remain constant during the tests, so the results were load compensated
based on the load change and effective compliance that seen by the
external encoders, but not the internal encoder (flexure compliance of
527N/um each and housing compliance of 900N/um for total effective
compliance of 203N/um, these are the values calculated by Moog). The
nominal load for the tension and compression tests was +/-15kN. For
modified actuators , the large-scale accuracy error maximum values for
modified actuators were 22.65 um, 24.76 um and 41.54 um for tension,
compression and zero load, respectively. For unmodified actuators , the
large-scale accuracy error maximum values were 14.32 um, 33.9 um and
21.42 um for tension, compression and zero load, respectively. For
reference, Moog's maximum error for large scale accuracy was
~\textless{} 17 um across the different load configurations. Apart from
the one anomaly (zero load), modified actuator's large scale accuracy
results are still acceptable as per the specifications. In addition to
that, the absolute accuracy is not critical for the operation of the
hexapods and corresponding hexapod level requirements were deemed to be
flexible for further relaxation.~

Small-scale accuracy was tested in a similar manner by moving to several
100um increments in each direction. The results were again load
compensated although the load changes were much smaller. The maximum
errors for modified and unmodified actuators were 17.7 um and 14 um
respectively. For reference, Moog's maximum error for small scale
accuracy was \textless{} 20 um. Hence, small scale accuracy test results
are within our expected value.~

\textbf{Repeatability Test}: Repeatability testing was performed by
moving from a zero position to a positive position, back to zero, to a
negative position, back to zero, and then repeated several times. The
nominal load for the tension and compression tests was +/-15kN and the
errors were load compensated in the same way as the accuracy results.The
unidirectional repeatability for both Unmodified and Modified actuators
as seen by the consistency of the errors at the +500um and -500um
positions is within \textasciitilde{}1um (Moog's results also achieved
\textasciitilde{}1um) . The bidirectional repeatability for both
Unmodified and Modified actuators as seen by the consistency of the
errors at the 0um position is within \textasciitilde{}1 um (Moog's
results also achieved \textasciitilde{}3 um). These results are
considered excellent performance and are expected to allow the hexapod
repeatability requirements to be met (\textless{} 5
um).\\[2\baselineskip]\textbf{Accelerated Life Test:} Accelerated life
testing was performed on the modified actuator unit. With a 20kN (4500
lbf) tension load applied (worst case mean load), the actuator was moved
through 20 cycles of the 20 command point sequence. The total travel was
335mm. Then a 20kN compression load was applied and the test was
repeated another 20 cycles of the 20 command point sequence for another
335mm of travel. This combined travel of 670 mm represents 1 month of
operation.This motion was successfully accomplished in approximately 2
hours with no unexpected stoppages or failures. We also monitored the
temperature of the actuator unit through an external temperature sensor
throughout the accelerated test period. Temperature mostly stayed within
1-2° C of ambient temperature (\textasciitilde{}25° C) and never reached
the critical threshold of 30° C. We kept a table fan running near the
test rig to represent the operational cooling
scenario.\\[2\baselineskip]In conclusion, the results of this test
campaign show that we may consider proceeding with the modification of
the remaining actuator units with a fair degree of assurance.

\subsection{Recommended Improvements}
\label{sect:recommendations}

The following are recommended improvements for what would do differently
when doing the acceptance testing of each actuator:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is necessary to align the external linear encoders such that they
  are reading the same value to improve accuracy of the measurements and
  avoid time consuming data adjustments.~
\item
  It was difficult and time-consuming to adjust the external encoders to
  ensure they are reading the tapes properly. We need to develop a more
  robust way to maintain the distance between the external linear
  encoders and the encoder tapes.~
\item
  We performed load compensation for the accuracy and repeatability
  tests.We used MOOG's calculated value for the total effective
  compliance as the test rig design was very similar. For future
  testing, we may calculate the total effective compliance of the test
  rig used in this test campaign to be more precise.~
\item
  During the accelerated life test, we were monitoring the temperature
  telemetry displayed in the software used for the test. But, we were
  not able to record the temperature for the whole run of the test as it
  stops recording the temperature in an external file after 5 minutes.
  It will be more helpful if we can determine a method to record the
  temperature in an external file continuously.~
\item
  We had to take screenshots/record manually to get the rotary and
  internal linear encoder readings, as we could not determine a way to
  export those values from the copley software. Hence, exporting the
  internal rotary encoder and internal linear encoder readings to an
  external file will improve future test data analysis.

The objective of this test cycle is to verify the redesign of the
actuator does not affect our ability to meet the hexapod requirements by
conducting a set of tests on a single actuator.~

\subsubsection{Software Version/Baseline}
Not provided.

\subsubsection{Configuration}
The hexapod actuator will require a load cell connected to two pneumatic
valves supplying air in order to provide load onto the actuator.

test case in Jira.

The purpose of this test case is set up the additional equipment needed
to run the actuator verification tests.

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
The test bench should already be set up according to the attached
drawing (800-000.pdf).

Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\When determining the center stroke position, the internal rotary encoder
reported -22.008mm. However, during the Unmodified Single Hexapod
Actuator Redesign Verification campaign, the center stroke position was
seen to be -40.202mm. Since the external linear encoders reported to be
about 39.5mm during both campaigns, this change seen in the center
stroke position was determined to be okay. One possible explanation for
why this was changed is because the actuator may have been rotated
during the modification which would have resulted in a different
internal rotary encoder reading.

\paragraph{ LVV-T2427 - Hexapod - Actuator Back Driving Test }\mbox{}\\

Version \textbf{1}.
Status \textbf{Approved}.
Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T2427}{\textit{ LVV-T2427 } }
test case in Jira.

The objective of this test case is to verify that removing the power
from an actuator will not cause the actuator to back drive even with the
application of different loads.

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
Proofing 200\% load test should be performed before running the
back-driving test.~

Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\During the Unmodified Actuator Verification campaign, the internal
rotary encoder reading was not recorded and so the displacement as
measured by the external linear encoders were recorded instead. However,
during this Modified Actuator Verification campaign, the back driving
test was able to be conducted using the readings from the internal
rotary encoder. As a result, it can be seen in the steps below that the
back driving measured during this test was measured to be under 10
counts for both tension and compression load. The data as measured by
the external linear encoders can be seen in the attached \emph{Back
Drive Test Results - Unmodified Actuator (1).xlsm} excel file.

test case in Jira.



\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\


Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\The actuator was placed as close to the positive limit switch as
possible when extended and as close to the negative limit switch as
possible when retracted.\\
As a reminder, the reported position of the rotary encoder were
different after the actuator modifications.\\
Negative Limit Switch:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-36.03mm or
  -36003000counts}
\end{itemize}

Zero Position:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-22.008mm or -2200875
  counts}
\end{itemize}

Positive Limit Switch:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-7.515mm or -7515000
  counts}
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, the stiffness of the actuator was seen in the following
positions as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Zero Position = 101.6N/um
\item
  Negative Limit Switch = 101.4N/um
\item
  Positive Limit Switch = 101.6N/um
\end{itemize}

The results from both the unmodified and modified actuator tests have
been uploaded into docushare. As seen in the Results Summary sheet,
Moog's results showed that the stiffness of the actuator was on average
117N/um. The results from the unmodified actuator stiffness test showed
that the actuator was on average 130N/um. It can be seen that the
actuator is a lot less stiff than MOOG's original results and the
results obtained from the unmodified test. It can be seen in the results
of the attached document that there is not only larger displacement in
the modified actuator test results, but there is a larger delta between
the two encoder positions. An explanation for this may be due to the
fact that the modified design includes a cutout meant for the external
encoder housing that is causing a twisting moment. As a result, this is
causing displacement at a higher rate for one encoder than the other.
This can be seen in the graphs plotting velocity of the encoders vs time
on the Velocity Graphs\emph{~}sheet of the
\href{https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Services/Document-55068}{\emph{Stiffness
Test Results Modified vs UnModified.xlsx}}file.

test case in Jira.

The purpose of this test will be to verify that the actuators are able
to move within their velocity and acceleration limits. Furthermore,
during the moves, we will also be verifying that the actuators do not
take more than 2 seconds to settle into place.~

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\


Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\Similar to MOOG's original procedure and the unmodified actuator
movement test, the settling time started when the actuator had reached
its commanded position of +/-5mm and ended when the displacement was
within 0.001mm of that position. As seen in the results of this test
case, the actuator was capable of accurately reaching the +/-5mm
commanded position and the settling time was again seen to be less than
2 seconds. This can be seen in the attached
\href{https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Services/Document-55079}{\emph{Movement
Test Results - Modified Actuator.xlsx}}\emph{~}excel file.\\
The results of both tension and compression were combined in order to
observe the actuator movement throughout the full test.

Status \textbf{Approved}.
Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T2432}{\textit{ LVV-T2432 } }
test case in Jira.

To verify that the range of motions for the actuators stay within the
determined limits.

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
The range limits should be determined to achieve the camera hexapod's
simultaneous range of motion requirements.

Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\The purpose of this test was to verify that the limit switches would
prevent the actuator from moving beyond an unsafe range of motion. The
actuator can incur serious damage if allowed to move beyond +/-15mm.
Therefore, the limits switches were set to be around +/-14.3mm, which is
within the +/-15mm but capable of allowing the overall hexapod range of
motion requirements to still be met.\\
During the Modified Actuator Verification Campaign, a new set of limit
switches had to be installed. However, the paddles on the limit switches
were not bent exactly like the original limit switches. As a result, the
limit switches had to be manually readjusted to trigger as close as
possible to the original +/-14.3mm. The calculations that were used to
determine the necessary adjustment are seen in the attached document.\\
Overall, this test was considered to be passed as the limit switches
were readjusted and seen to stop the actuator from moving beyond its
range of motion. The full range of motion is listed below:\\
Negative Limit Switch:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-36.03mm or
  -36003000counts}
\item
  Encoder A (D13B) = 53.28mm
\item
  Encoder B (D0BD) = 53.73mm
\end{itemize}

Zero Position:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-22.008mm or -2200875
  counts}
\item
  Encoder A (D13B) = 39.4mm
\item
  Encoder B (D0BD) = 39.5mm
\end{itemize}

Positive Limit Switch:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-7.515mm or
  -7515000counts}
\item
  Encoder A (D13B) = 24.78mm
\item
  Encoder B (D0BD) = 25.23mm
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, the stiffness of the actuator was seen in the following
positions as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Zero Position = 101.6N/um
\item
  Negative Limit Switch = 101.4N/um
\item
  Positive Limit Switch = 101.6N/um~

test case in Jira.



\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
This test can be performed at any starting position within the
actuator's range of motion that allow the test to be completed without
exceeding the software range limits. It is preferable to use different
starting positions for different actuators although no performance
deviations are expected.~\\[2\baselineskip]

Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\The expected result of this test was that given 100nm moves with any
load, the actuator would reach the commanded position within 50nm.
However, there were some deviations to the 100nm moves seen to be
greater than 50nm. This was expected as MOOG's original test results
described similar issues related to excessive noise on the load cell and
on the external encoders. Additionally, a load compensation could not be
performed with the displacement being measured in nm's. Therefore, since
the encoders were seen to be able to track the actuator movement closely
and in the correct commanded direction, this test was passed.

Accuracy requirements in \citeds{LTS-206}.~

Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\For this we started at the Zero Position:\\

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Copley Software: Active Load Position = \textbf{-22.008mm or -2200875
  counts}
\item
  Encoder A (D13B) = 39.4mm
\item
  Encoder B (D0BD) = 39.5mm
\end{itemize}

During this test, it can be seen in the results that there were
variations in the applied load that may have impacted the results of
this test. As a result of the noise, there were outliers to the expected
accuracy, specifically for the larger moves in mm. For the smaller moves
in um, the accuracy was less than the expected error. However, this was
expected as MOOG's original test report cites the same variation when
applying load. Therefore, load compensation was applied to the results
in an effort to reduce the noise's impact on the results. Applying load
compensation improved the overall results, but there were still some
outliers that were greater than the expected 17um for the large moves:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Large scale accuracy maximum error - Tension = \textbf{22.65um}
\item
  Large scale accuracy maximum error - Compression = \textbf{24.76um}
\item
  Large scale accuracy maximum error - Zero = \textbf{41.54um}
\end{itemize}

For the smaller moves, the maximum error was less than the expected
20um:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Small scale accuracy maximum error - Tension = 12.25um
\item
  Small scale accuracy maximum error - Compression = 17.7um
\item
  Small scale accuracy maximum error - Zero = 16.8um
\end{itemize}

Overall, the absolute accuracy of the actuators are not critical for the
operation of the hexapods. Therefore, the results have been recorded and
this test was marked as passed.

\paragraph{ LVV-T2435 - Hexapod - Actuator Repeatability Test }\mbox{}\\

Version \textbf{1}.
Status \textbf{Approved}.
Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T2435}{\textit{ LVV-T2435 } }
test case in Jira.

The objective of this test case will be to re-verify the hexapod
actuator repeatability requirements as stated in \citeds{LTS-206}. This will be
done by repeating a series of moves in order to verify that the
deviation between the sets of moves is not greater than 5um.~

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\


Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\Similar to the execution of this test with the unmodified actuator, the
repeatability was determined by observing the measured displacement of
the actuator after completing a move and settle. As seen in the final
comparison of results in the
\href{https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Services/Document-55071}{\emph{Repeatibility
Test Results -Modified vs UnModified.xlsx}} document, both the modified
and unmodified actuator had a repeatibility of less than 5um.\\

\paragraph{ LVV-T2431 - Hexapod - Actuator Accelerated Life Test }\mbox{}\\

Version \textbf{1}.
Status \textbf{Approved}.
Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T2431}{\textit{ LVV-T2431 } }
test case in Jira.

The objective of this test case will be to verify the actuator will
withstand at least a month's worth of operation by commanding it through
a repetitive sequence of motions.

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
In order to execute this test case, all other Hexapod re-verification
tests must be complete and the actuator should be connected to the
pneumatic cylinder.

Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\An initial sequence of 20 moves was performed and the actuator
temperature was seen to rise from 23.65degC to 28.5degC without any
indication of stopping. The operational limit of the actuator drive was
cited to be from 0 to 40degC. Therefore, we added a fan to prevent the
temperature from increasing beyond 30degC during the test. During the
tests, the temperature readings could not be exported while the
telemetry was being displayed in real time. Therefore, the temperature
telemetry was left on display to verify the temperature never reached
above 30degC. As a result of this test, the temperature never rose
beyond 30degC with the fan on the actuator and there were no obvious
damage/faults on the actuator.~

\paragraph{ LVV-T2844 - Hexapod - Actuator Linear Encoder Validation }\mbox{}\\

Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T2844}{\textit{ LVV-T2844 } }
test case in Jira.

The objective of this test case is to simply verify that moving the
actuator with an operational load does not affect the spacing between
the linear encoder and the encoder tape.

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\


Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\The purpose of this test was to ensure that the application of load was
not affecting the results by causing the encoders to separate too far
from the encoder tapes. As a result of this test, it was visually
confirmed that the encoders remained properly spaced during commanded
moves with load applied.\\
As seen in the videos included in the docushare collection, the encoders
visually remain the same distance away from the encoder tape. However,
the real indication that the encoders are sufficiently spaced is the LED
on the encoder. The LED turns blue when the encoder is the correct
distance away from the encoder tape. If the LED is green, orange, or
red, this indicates the signal is not as strong (with red being the
worst). However, since the encoders were seen to be blue for the full
test, this test can be considered to be passed.

Status \textbf{Approved}.
Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T2435}{\textit{ LVV-T2435 } }
test case in Jira.

The objective of this test case will be to re-verify the hexapod
actuator repeatability requirements as stated in \citeds{LTS-206}. This will be
done by repeating a series of moves in order to verify that the
deviation between the sets of moves is not greater than 5um.~

voltages of the hexapod actuator test rig. In addition to validating the
amount of force applied for each voltage, this test will also validate
the test rig can be safely commanded to 60kN in both compression and
tension.

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\


Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\The test was executed initially by applying steps for forces in
compression first and then tension. When applying forces in compression,
we started with the supply pressure = 20psi. As we applied more load in
compression, we also gradually increased the air supply. By doing this,
we were able to safely observe the rate that the load was being applied
at lower pressures first before increasing to the maximum air pressure.
As a result, we determined that load could be applied safely onto the
actuator and at least 90psi is required to be able to apply a load of
+/-60kN.

test case in Jira.

The purpose of this test case is set up the additional equipment needed
to run the actuator verification tests.

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
The test bench should already be set up according to the attached
drawing (800-000.pdf).

Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\This test case includes the installation of the actuator onto the test
rig and validation of the Copley software control. As seen in the
results, we validated the position of the positive and negative limit
switches. After determining the positions of those, we calculated the
zero position to be exactly half the distance between the two limit
switches = \textbf{-40202000 counts or -40.202mm.}

\paragraph{ LVV-T2427 - Hexapod - Actuator Back Driving Test }\mbox{}\\

Version \textbf{1}.
Status \textbf{Approved}.
Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T2427}{\textit{ LVV-T2427 } }
test case in Jira.

The objective of this test case is to verify that removing the power
from an actuator will not cause the actuator to back drive even with the
application of different loads.

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
Proofing 200\% load test should be performed before running the
back-driving test.~

Execution status: {\bf Initial Pass }

Final comment:\\The proofing 200\% load test will not be conducted as part of this test
cycle. Therefore, it was not a pre-requisite to executing this test
case. See
\href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa\#/testPlayer/testExecution/LVV-E2728}{LVV-E2728}.\\[2\baselineskip]During
MOOG's original test, the back driving was determined by reading the
internal rotary encoder and therefore was measured in counts. During
this test, the displacement was measured by the external linear encoders
and was measured in mm. As seen in the results, the total displacement
by either encoder when applying loads never exceeded 0.32mm. The results
were agreed to be sufficient to repeat this test on the modified
actuator.

\paragraph{ LVV-T2428 - Hexapod - Actuator Stiffness Test }\mbox{}\\

Version \textbf{1}.
Status \textbf{Approved}.
Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T2428}{\textit{ LVV-T2428 } }
test case in Jira.



\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\


Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\Moog's results already determined that, effective serial test stand
stiffness was very high and had less than 1\% impact on the measured
stiffness of the actuators. We also got similar results while
calculating stiffness with surrogate.\\
In conclusion, the stiffness of the actuator was seen in the following
positions as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Zero Position = 131.6 N/um
\item
  Extended Position (Positive Limit position) = 135.39 N/um
\item
  Retracted Position (Negative Limit position) = 126.69 N/um
\end{itemize}

The calculation of these final results can be found in the

Test Results Modified vs Unmodified.xlsx}}\emph{~}document

Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T2437}{\textit{ LVV-T2437 } }
test case in Jira.

The purpose of this test will be to verify that the actuators are able
to move within their velocity and acceleration limits. Furthermore,
during the moves, we will also be verifying that the actuators do not
take more than 2 seconds to settle into place.~

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\


Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\During the test, the velocity and acceleration limits could not be
changed in the Copley control software. However, the limits were already
set to the desired velocity and acceleration. As a result, we verified
that the actuator was still capable of meeting the minimum velocity of
the 0.342mm/s. The settling time was also verified by this test.\\
According to MOOG's original procedure, the settling time started when
the actuator had reached its commanded position of +/-5mm and ended when
the displacement was within 0.001mm of that commanded position. As seen
in the results of this test case, the settling time was always seen to
be less than 2 seconds. This is supported by the raw data as seen in the
\href{https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Services/Document-55090}{\emph{Movement
Test Results - Unmodified Actuator.xlsx}}\emph{~}document.

Final comment:\\The original scope of this test was to verify the position of the
positive and negative limit switches using the Copley Control software.
There were additional steps involved based on MOOG's original procedure
that cited that the software limit switches would be set and needed to
be adjusted in order to do so. However, MOOG used additional software to
set and adjust the software limit switches of the actuator. Therefore,
those steps were skipped for the purposes of this test and only the
steps related to determining the physical limit switches were tested.~

test case in Jira.



\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\
This test can be performed at any starting position within the
actuator's range of motion that allow the test to be completed without
exceeding the software range limits. It is preferable to use different
starting positions for different actuators although no performance
deviations are expected.~\\[2\baselineskip]

Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\The test was performed starting from the zero position (Active Copley =
-40.202mm).\\[2\baselineskip]The expected result of this test was that
given 100nm moves with any load, the actuator would reach the commanded
position within 50nm. However, there were some deviations to the 100nm
moves seen to be greater than 50nm. This was expected as MOOG's original
test results described similar issues related to excessive noise on the
load cell and on the external encoders. Additionally, a load
compensation could not be performed with the displacement being measured
in nm's. Therefore, since the encoders were seen to be able to track the
actuator movement closely and in the correct commanded direction, this
test was passed.

Final comment:\\During this test, it can be seen in the results that there were
variations in the applied load that may have impacted the results of
this test. As a result of the noise, there were outliers to the expected
accuracy, specifically for the larger moves in mm. For the smaller moves
in um, the accuracy was less than the expected error. However, this was
expected as MOOG's original test report cites the same variation when
applying load. Therefore, load compensation was applied to the results
in an effort to reduce the noise's impact on the results. Applying load
compensation improved the overall results, but there were still some
outliers that were greater than the expected 17um for the large moves:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Large scale accuracy maximum error - Tension = 14.3um
\item
  Large scale accuracy maximum error - Compression = \textbf{33.9um}
\item
  Large scale accuracy maximum error - Zero = \textbf{21.4um}
\end{itemize}

For the smaller moves, the maximum error was less than the expected
20um:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Small scale accuracy maximum error - Tension = 8.7um
\item
  Small scale accuracy maximum error - Compression = 14um
\item
  Small scale accuracy maximum error - Zero = 10.25um

\paragraph{ LVV-T2435 - Hexapod - Actuator Repeatability Test }\mbox{}\\

Version \textbf{1}.
Status \textbf{Approved}.
Open  \href{https://jira.lsstcorp.org/secure/Tests.jspa#/testCase/LVV-T2435}{\textit{ LVV-T2435 } }
test case in Jira.

The objective of this test case will be to re-verify the hexapod
actuator repeatability requirements as stated in \citeds{LTS-206}. This will be
done by repeating a series of moves in order to verify that the
deviation between the sets of moves is not greater than 5um.~

\textbf{ Preconditions}:\\


Execution status: {\bf Pass }

Final comment:\\There were three iterations of this test, once with a +15kN load
applied, once with a -15kN load applied and once with no load applied.
For each test, the actuator was commanded through a series of four 500um
moves repeated five times. In order to determine the repeatability of
the actuator, the displacement was measured once the actuator had
completed its 500um move. As seen in the
\href{https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Services/Document-55071}{\emph{Repeatability
Test Results -Modified vs Unmodified Actuator.xlsx}}\emph{~}file, the
repeatability error (calculated using rms method) was never seen to be
greater than 1um so this test was passed.
